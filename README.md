### Name
Investing Simulation using MPT

### Year
2019

### Overview
This project features an investment simulation tool based on the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) Model. It enables users to craft a personalized investment strategy by selecting specific companies, defining a simulation test period, setting initial capital, and accounting for transaction costs.

### Features
- **Customizable Investment Choices**: Users can select the companies they wish to invest in.
- **Simulation Test Period**: Users can define the duration of the investment simulation.
- **Initial Capital Management**: Users can specify the amount of initial capital available for investment.
- **Transaction Cost Accounting**: The system includes the cost of each transaction in the simulation.

### Functionality
The system is designed to automatically download daily stock quotes for each selected company from Yahoo Finance. It employs the MPT model to minimize the standard deviation of the portfolio's monthly returns. The investment capital is allocated across the chosen stocks every month based on the optimized weights, starting from the initial date of the simulation.

### How It Works
Utilizing the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory, the project dynamically adjusts the investment portfolio to achieve the most efficient risk-return balance. By minimizing the portfolio's standard deviation, it aims to optimize the allocation of capital among the selected stocks, enhancing the potential for higher returns on investment.
