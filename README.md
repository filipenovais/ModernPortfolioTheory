Personal Project
--------

- Name: Investing Simulation using MPT
- Year: 2019

The system simulates an investment using a Modern Portfolio Theory Model where the user can choose:
- The companies he/she wishes to invest
- The test period of the simulation
- The Initial Capital available to invest
- The cost of each transaction

The system automatically downloads daily stock quotes of each company from yahoo and minimizes the standard deviation of the monthly portfolio returns. All the available capital is distributed every month according to the resulting WEIGHTS, starting from the initial simulation date.
