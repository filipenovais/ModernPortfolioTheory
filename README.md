- Name: Investing Simulation using MPT
- Year: 2019

The system simulates an investment where the user can choose:

- The test period of the simulation

The system automaticaly downloads daily stock quotes of each company from yahoo and minimizes the standard deviation of the monthly portfolio returns. All the available capital is distributed every month acording to the resulting WEIGHTS, starting from the initial simulation date.
