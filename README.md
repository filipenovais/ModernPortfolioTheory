# Modern Portfolio Theory Investment Simulation

## Overview

This project is a personal initiative aimed at simulating investments using the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) model. It allows users to simulate an investment strategy by selecting companies to invest in, defining a test period, allocating initial capital, and considering transaction costs. The simulation automates the process of downloading daily stock quotes from Yahoo Finance and applies MPT to minimize the standard deviation of the portfolio's monthly returns, thereby optimizing the portfolio's performance over the specified period.

## Features

- **Company Selection:** Users can choose specific companies for their investment simulation.
- **Simulation Period:** Define the duration for the investment simulation to run.
- **Initial Capital Allocation:** Specify the amount of capital available for investment at the beginning of the simulation.
- **Transaction Costs:** Consider the costs associated with each transaction within the simulation.
